## Motivations

I am equally as interested in documenting life with a camera as I am interested in improving lives with compe/cs. I primarily shoot with the film camera on **B&W** film stocks and have learned to develop and scan my own negatives. Traditional film scanners utilize technology known as [Digital ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_ICE). Developed by Kodak in the 60/70s this technology effectively cleans **C41 (color)** film scans by using an infrared scan to detect objects, namely dust/scratches on film. My emphasis on what I shoot and what the technology scans best is important because when it comes to B&W, the makeup of these film stocks have silver halide particles. These infrared scan does not recognize the particles and thus makes it difficult to remove the objects. 

While I was not willing to sacrifice my love for B&W for the increased time it takes to ensure there are no unwanted objects on the scans, I did wish there was a way to decrease the time it would take to remove them. There are already existing applications that allow you to remove unwanted things from your image via software (e.g. Photoshop, Lightroom), but they still require human interaction. So in an effort to do this process WITHOUT manual intervention feather was born.
